MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE HUNGRY FOR A WAY TO DROP WEIGHT.

00:05.66 --> 00:08.70
TODAY'S NEWS: ONE DIET DOESN'T FIT ALL.

00:08.70 --> 00:11.93
- We wanted to do a long-term two-year trial to test

00:11.93 --> 00:15.83
head-to-head low-carb, low-fat and mediterranean diet.

00:15.83 --> 00:19.56
ALL THREE HELPED PEOPLE LOSE WEIGHT - ON AVERAGE, 7 POUNDS ON

00:19.56 --> 00:23.20
THE LOW-FAT DIET, 10 ON A MEDITERRANEAN DIET RICH IN FISH,

00:23.20 --> 00:27.16
VEGETABLES, AND OLIVE OIL, AND 12 ON A MOSTLY MEAT-FREE VERSION

00:27.16 --> 00:28.80
OF THE LOW-CARB DIET.

00:28.80 --> 00:32.93
They experienced the sharpest rapid weight loss, because the

00:32.93 --> 00:36.06
low-carb diet is quite satiating, and you just -

00:36.06 --> 00:38.26
you don't feel like eating a lot.

00:38.26 --> 00:42.23
SURPRISINGLY, THE LOW-CARB DIET, RELATIVELY HIGH IN FAT,

00:42.23 --> 00:45.10
ALSO HAD THE BEST EFFECT ON CHOLESTEROL LEVELS.

00:45.10 --> 00:47.63
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET WAS BEST

00:47.63 --> 00:51.26
AT LOWERING BLOOD SUGAR IN DIABETICS, AND LOW-FAT MAY NOT

00:51.26 --> 00:53.13
BE FIRST CHOICE ANYMORE.

00:53.13 --> 00:55.93
They don't taste as good, and they're actually not as healthy

00:55.93 --> 00:59.33
as the moderate-fat Mediterranean style diet.
